<h3><a id="PWDB algorithms" class="anchor" href="#pwdb-algorthims" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Summary</h3>

<p>
  On this page we provide links to the algorithms used to: (i) create the <a href="pwdb.html">database</a> of arterial pulse waves; and (ii) analyse the resulting pulse waves.
   The algorithms have a broad range of uses. Firstly, they can be used to reproduce the work carried out in this project.
   Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, they can be used for further research: for pulse wave analysis studies, and to create additional pulse wave databases representative of different patient populations.

<h3><a id="Algorithms used to create the Pulse Wave Database" class="anchor" href="#pwdb-design-algorthims" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Algorithms used to create the Pulse Wave Database</h3>

<p>The pulse wave database was created in three steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li><b><a href="#">Creating model input files</a></b>: The text files used as inputs to the computational model of pulse wave propagation were created in Matlab &reg; .</li>
  <li><b><a href="#">Running pulse wave simulations</a></b>: The <a href="http://haemod.uk/nektar">Nektar1D</a> model of pulse wave propagation was used to simulate pulse waves. This produced a set of output files for each simulation.</li>
  <li><b><a href="#">Post-processing model output files</a></b>: Data were extracted from the model output files, and processed in Matlab &reg; .</li>
</ol>

<h3><a id="Pulse Wave Analysis Algorithms" class="anchor" href="#pwa-algorthims" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Pulse Wave Analysis Algorithms</h3>

<p>The following Matlab &reg; algorithms were used for pulse wave analysis in this work:</p>
<ol>
  <li><b><a href="#">PulseAnalyse</a></b>: A script for identifying fiducial points (such as systolic and diastolic peaks) on pulse waves, and taking feature measurements (such as the augmentation index).</li>
  <li><b><a href="https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/37746-ttalgorithm">TTalgorithm</a></b>: A script for measuring the pulse transit time between two pulse waves.</li>
  <li><b><a href="http://www.bg.ic.ac.uk/research/k.parker/wave_intensity_web/kreservoir_v10.m">kreservoir</a></b>: A script for estimating the reservoir pressure from a pressure wave.</li>  
</ol>
