<h3><a id="PWDB algorithms" class="anchor" href="#pwdb-algorthims" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Summary</h3>

<p>
  On this page we provide links to the algorithms used to: (i) create the <a href="pwdb.html">database</a> of arterial pulse waves; and (ii) analyse the resulting pulse waves.
   The algorithms have a broad range of uses. Firstly, they can be used to reproduce the work carried out in this project.
   Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, they can be used for further research: for pulse wave analysis, and to create additional pulse wave databases representative of different patient populations.

<p>Research into respiratory rate algorithms has been hindered by a lack of open-source algorithms.
Consequently, one aim of this project is to provide open-source algorithms to facilitate future research.
As stated in the licence accompanying the source code, the algorithms are not intended to be fit for any purpose.
Instead, they act as an platform from which researchers can develop algorithms.</p>

<p>The following resources are provided:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b><a href="https://github.com/peterhcharlton/RRest/archive/master.zip">Algorithm Source Code</a></b>: The latest version of the toolbox of algorithms.</li>
  <li><b><a href="https://github.com/peterhcharlton/RRest/wiki">User Manual</a></b>: A helpful resource for new users of the toolbox.</li>
  <li><b><a href="https://github.com/peterhcharlton/RRest">Github Repository</a></b>: A repository of all versions of the toolbox, past and present.</li>
</ul>
