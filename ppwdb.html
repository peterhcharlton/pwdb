<h3><a id="Summary" class="anchor" href="#datasets" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Overview</h3>

<p>The Preliminary Pulse Wave Database is a set of simulated arterial pulse waves for 258 virtual subjets aged from 25 to 75 years old (in 10 year increments). 
The database contains a baseline simulation for each of the six age groups, which was created using cardiovascular properties (such as heart rate and arterial stiffness) which are representative of healthy subjects at each age group.
It also contains a further 42 virtual subjects at each age group, in which one of the cardiovascuar properties was varied from its baseline value whilst all others were held constant at their baseline values.
This allows for preliminary analyses of the performance of pulse wave analysis algorithms.
	    </p>
	    
<h3><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Details</h3>

<p>The dataset contains arterial flow velocity (U), luminal area (A), pressure (P) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) pulse waves at a range of measurement sites, including: (i) aorta (ascending and descending); (ii) carotid artery; (iii) brachial artery; (iv) radial artery; (v) finger; and (vi) femoral artery.
</p>
	  
<p>An overview of the dataset, inclduing details on its design and validation, is provided in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8aPZFs8c08&t=7s">talk</a> accompanying <a href="ppwdb_presentation.html">this publication</a>.
	
<h3><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Limitations</h3>
	  
<p>
The utility of this dataset is restricted because the virtual subjects cannot be considered to be representative of a sample of healthy adults, as cardiovascular properties were only varied indpendently, whereas in reality an individual's cardiovascular properties are all slightly different from the norm for their age.

<p>The dataset was first reported at the <a href="https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/modelling-arterial-pulse-wave-propagation-during-healthy-ageing(6579ac0c-f092-4ab5-9dc6-2a7aeda6c78d).html">2018 World Congress of Biomechanics</a>. 
Further detail was subsequently provided in <a href="ppwdb_presentation.html">this publication</a>, which contains additional information on how the dataset was designed and validated.
