<p>The arterial pulse wave contains a wealth of information on both the heart and the blood vessels. Consequently, several pulse wave analysis algorithms have been proposed to assess cardiovascular properties from the pulse wave. These measurement techniques have the advantage of being non-invasive, and relatively cheap. However, it is difficult to assess their performance across a range of cardiovascular conditions <i>in vivo</i>. The aim of this project is to create a database of simulated pulse waves, representative of those which would be measured in a sample of healthy adults, to facilitate <i>in silico</i> assessments of pulse wave analysis algorithms.</p>
