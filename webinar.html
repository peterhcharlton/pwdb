<p>This webinar provides a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art in estimating respiratory rate (RR) from the electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG). It was intended to equip researchers with the knowledge and tools to translate this promising technology into patient benefit.</p>

<p>Respiratory rate (RR) is a key physiological parameter, used in a range of clinical settings for diagnosis and prognosis. Despite its importance, it is usually measured by hand. Over the past 50 years many techniques have been developed to estimate RR from two widely acquired physiological signals: the electrocardiogram (ECG) and pulse oximetry signal (photoplethysmogram, PPG). Although these techniques have been the subject of much research, they have not yet been widely integrated into clinical practice.</p>

<p>The webinar began with an introduction to the topic, covering the clinical importance of RR, and the literature on RR algorithms. The signal processing techniques used in RR algorithms were then explained, highlighting potential areas for future algorithm developments. </p>

<p>The webinar considered assessing the performance of RR algorithms, and implementing them in equipment. The performances of a wide range of RR algorithms were discussed, providing a framework for selecting an appropriate RR algorithm for use in a particular clinical setting. The technical and physiological factors to consider when designing RR monitoring systems and choosing appropriate clinical settings were also outlined.</p>

<p>Finally, promising future research directions were outlined. The publicly available resources for research into RR algorithms were summarised, equipping researchers with the tools for further development and assessment of RR algorithms.</p>
